## node-fetch-commonjs
> `node-fetch` but in a single-file CommonJS format.

### node-fetch
> Instead of implementing XMLHttpRequest in Node.js to run browser-specific Fetch polyfill, why not go from native http to fetch API directly? Hence, node-fetch, minimal code for a window.fetch compatible API on Node.js runtime.

> See Jason Miller's isomorphic-unfetch or Leonardo Quixada's cross-fetch for isomorphic usage (exports node-fetch for server-side, whatwg-fetch for client-side).

## nodemon
> nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## DotEnv
> Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
